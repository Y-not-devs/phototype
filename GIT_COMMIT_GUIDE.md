feat: Implement complete language detection microservices architecture

- Add router service to orchestrate document analysis pipeline
- Enable lang-detect service with proper FastAPI endpoints  
- Update frontend to use router service for language detection
- Add comprehensive workflow: PDF → Router → Lang-detect/OCR pipeline
- Include aiohttp and pdf2image dependencies
- Add test scripts for service verification

Key features:
* Router service coordinates preprocessor → OCR → language detection
* Direct language detection from PDF text layers when available
* Fallback to OCR pipeline for image-only PDFs
* Enhanced frontend with detected language information
* Proper service health checks and error handling

Files changed:
- NEW: router/router-service/app/main.py (complete orchestration service)
- NEW: router/test_services.py (testing utilities)
- MODIFIED: run.py (enable router and lang-detect services)
- MODIFIED: frontend-service/app.py (integrate router service)
- MODIFIED: requirements.txt (add aiohttp, pdf2image)
```
